description: This resource provides information about a  MATLAB function performs
  the explicit calculations required to perform a least squares analysis of data for
  fitting a linear model. The user inputs the design matrix X (which is assumed to
  have a y-intercept), a column vector of measured values y, and the appropriate t
  values used for the confidence interval and the number of degrees of freedom.

description: This resource provides information about a procedure that takes as input
  the number of fields and an integer mask that is non-zero only at the interior points,
  and returns the epsilon vector that identifies in the full DAE set which are the
  ordinary differential equations (epsilon(k)=1) and which are the algebraic equations
  (epsilon(k)=0) arising from the boundary conditions.
